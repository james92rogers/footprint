## Overview: ##

This was my second project as part of General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering course. In pairs, we were given 48 hours to create a frontend application that used an existing free API. My partner (the wonderful [Hannah Hill](https://github.com/hannah-hill)) and I decided to use the Carbon Interface API to create a site where users could work out their carbon footprint depending on a flight or car journey they were taking, and from that determine how many trees would need to be planted to offset that journey.
